# DataAnalysisAndVisualization
The repository contains projects done as a part of my self learning with Python libraries such as Seaborn, Pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib. It also contains projects in Machine Learning and using Logistic Regressions and multiple regression.

#Project 1:
University Admission Prediction

In the project, I have trained regression models to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile. This project could be practically used to get the university acceptance rate for individual students using web application.

Steps to run the notebook:
1. Install Jupyter notebook through Anaconda
2. Create an environment with installed Tensore flow in Anaconda
3. Run the code in Jupyter notebook by importing necessary libraries and packages.
4. To install anaconda packages use the following command and then import the packages: conda install -c anaconda seaborn
5. Run the entire notebook or each cell individually.

#Project 2:
Box Office Analysis

In this project, I worked with the The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set. The motion picture industry is raking in more revenue than ever with its expansive growth the world over. I build a model to accurately predict movie revenue. The results from these models be used to further increase revenue. I tried to answer these questions by way of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering using Seaborn. I primarily used Plotly for data visualization. Plotly Python which is Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs ready for both online and offline use.

Steps to run the notebook:
1. The test and train data csv files are already added in the folder.
2. Clone the folder in your local system.
3. Add the csv file address in the Jupyter notebook.
4. Run the entire notebook or each cell individually.
